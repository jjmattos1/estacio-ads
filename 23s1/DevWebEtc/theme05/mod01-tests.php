// PHP is like Javascript regarding the variable declaration, you dont define the variable types.
/*
The ** operator serves to exponentiate the second variable:
$test = 10 ** 2;
In this case the value of the test variable is 100.

Request variables:

$_GET = retrieve data
$_POST = send data
$_REQUEST = retrieve/send data
